# A mixin that can be used for controls operations like
#  create:
#          - CREATE  lifecyle ops like START, STOP, RESTART, DELETE which submits /catrequests to gateway
#  destroy:
#          - DESTROY an assembly  or catalog.
#            this action gets called prior to a start, stop, restart, delete operation
#            a confirmation is got from the user to perform the same.
